# Architecture
### AWS Environments
![AwsArchitecture](https://i.ibb.co/z2P0rZy/aws-architecture.jpg)

We will use AWS for our stack, and only implement a staging environment to save on cost. By using `AWS Cloudformation` we have the ability to easily spin up and tear down complete stacks at will both from the developer's cli or from out CICD pipeline. 

| IaaS | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Elastic Container Registry (ECR)` | We will use this for our Docker container registry |
| `Elastic Container Service (ECS)` | This is the cluster where our Dockerized containers will run. We could also use EKS (Kubernetes) but man, is it overkill |
| `LoadBalancer` | Poke a whole in the private network into our VPC and expose the Dockerized Node and/or React app. This helps us scale up and down with multiple containers as our scale grows. |


### Docker Multi Stage Build
We have Dockerfiles optimised for the `dev` local docker machine and `prod` which will be deployed to `AWS` environment for ```QA, UAT, Staging/PreProd and Prod```. Ideally I want one Dockerfile but Docker multi build doesn't support if/else logic yet. 

![Docker Mutli Stage Build](https://i.ibb.co/g93MfFk/docker-multi-stage-build.png)

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Build` |  Universal build |
| `Build4Prod` |  Build for Production |
| `Quality` | `optional` Code Quality and Security | 
| `Test` |  Lint, Test and Code Coverage  |
| `Dev` |  Docker optimised for Dev environment with nodemon, used for Developers desktop with hot loading et al  |
| `Prod` |  Production ready minified and optimised and SSR for `nginx`   |



# Project Plan 
Let's plan our sprint. We'll use Github project board available here [https://github.com/mitni455/sca-dev-test/projects/1](https://github.com/mitni455/sca-dev-test/projects/1)
and the [milestones](https://github.com/mitni455/sca-dev-test/milestones)

### User Stories 
So the way I translate the wireframes to User Stories, and User Stories to code is as follows. 

![Semantic Commit Workflow](https://i.ibb.co/9sy2spT/smart-commits.png)
> a similar pattern with Jira 

* Break the UI up into components. These include Layouts (Pages), components/containers and state management/services
* A User Story is the smallest thing you can ship to the end user that isnt weirdly out of place or doesn't work. e.g. if you put a button in prod with no handler the User would think it's broken. I typically try strip all the stuff out and say "would this add any value to end user?" 
* Definition of Done (DoD) is the Acceptance Criteria (AC). AC is written in Gherkin syntax (`GIVEN/WHEN/THEN`) so it can be converted immediately into code stubs (`cucumber` with `Cypress` for e2e and `Jest` for Unit Tests). 
* Features and User Stories are the same thing. I dont try differentiaite the two. Does a feature have multiple stories or Stories multiple features... Dont waste your brain cycles. It just depends. 
* That said I always branch for each User Story, hence the `feat(feature id): User Story`
* Use `semantic commits` with the following syntax: 
```
git checkout -b feature/{user story}
git commit -am "feat(sub task): add (not added) feature here" 
```

## Runtime setup
- `Next.Js`: used for modern react 
- `Docker`: container for consistent dev and prod environments 


## test setup
- `jest.config.js`: use `ts-jest` to test TypeScript files; use mocks for imported CSS/LESS files; use TypeScript compiler to handle both TS/JS files
- `jest.setup.js`: use `enzyme` to test the rendered component 
- `tsconfig.jest.json`: allow JavaScript files (e.g., `jest.setup.js`) during the test
- `next.config.js`: just an ordinary Next.js config (with TypeScript and CSS support)
